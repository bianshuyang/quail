Quail (Question Bank Browser)

New:
Allow \*mboss-style question - e.g. if you click on the question, you got more trials until you got it correct. Correspondingly, it is preferred for html to have specific div tags that hide correct answer. 
Also, allows for tracing back of the question attempt history like in us\*le-rx style question, but better: all attempts would be recorded and refreshing wouldn't generally help.
